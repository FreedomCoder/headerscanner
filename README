TODO List for HeaderScanner Library

Test to see if the webserver is working as a web proxy 
For example 
do a

GET http://URL/ HTTP/1.0   o  GET HTTP://URL:PORT/ HTTP/1.0

if I get a response of  HTTP/1.1 200 OK .. 
it should return that we can use the web server as a web proxy 
Another way we could check for a web proxy is to use the actual command CONNECT

CONNECT URL:PORT HTTP/1.0

if we get something close to HTTP/1.1 Connection established ...  eureka ! 
If we are able to establish a connection , usually on port 443 , this will allow us to proxy 
comms through that port meaning that we can perform tests on local IP address 

GET http://192.168.1.1:22 HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
Connection: close

SSH-20.-OpenSSH_4.2.....

if we get a 502 bad gateway the port is close.
if we get a 502 proxy error means that we do not have a banner but the port IS open.
